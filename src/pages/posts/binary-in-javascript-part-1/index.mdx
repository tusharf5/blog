Javascript added support for working with binary-data in ES6 with the addition of `ArrayBuffer` and `TypedArray` sub-classes.
Prior to that, there was no standard way of working with binary-data in Javascript.

The [`Buffer`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#class-buffer) class is a built-in global in Nodejs to work with binary data. It is not part of 
the Javascript spec though.
Nodejs Buffer pre-dates Javascript's [`ArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer)
but after ES6, nodejs changed the Buffer's implementation to make it compatible with ES6's `ArrayBuffer`.

A `byte` is the smallest unit of data that we can work with in Javascript & Nodejs.
`Buffer`, `Chunk`, `ArrayBuffer` are similar terms used to represent a sequence of `bytes`.
Binary data always comes in `chunks`.

## How is binary data stored?

Binary data in Javascript is stored internally as a `Buffer` (Nodejs) or `ArrayBuffer` (Nodejs & Browsers).

When you open a file, Nodejs will store the entire file in a single `Buffer` instance.
If you are receiving the file from network, Nodejs might send you the file data in multiple `chunks` where each chunk
is a `Buffer` instance.

Since `ArrayBuffer` is part of the Javascript Spec, it can be used in browsers too. In fact you can read a file as an `ArrayBuffer`
using the `FileReader.readAsArrayBuffer()` method, you can also read binary data from XHR/fetch requests using an `ArrayBuffer`.

```javascript
// xhr
xhr.open('GET', aUrl, true);
xhr.responseType = 'arraybuffer';

// fetch
fetch('url').then((response) => response.arrayBuffer());
```

In this post, we'll look at `ArrayBuffer` in more detail but the same concepts can be applied to `Buffer`. The difference in 
an ArrayBuffer and Buffer is mostly in their API.

An ArrayBuffer represents a contiguos block of memory as a sequence of bytes.

Although it doesn't have any methods to read or modify the underlying data, you can create a data access layer on top of the `ArrayBuffer`.
to access/modify the underlying data.

There are two data access layers available to work with the `ArrayBuffer`. `Typed Arrays` classes and the `DataView` class.


```javascript
const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(numBytes);

buffer[0]; // does not work ❌

const int8 = new Uint8Array(buffer);

int8[0]; // works ✅

const dataview = new DataView(buffer);

dataview.getUint8(0); // works ✅
```

### Why can't we directly access the contents of an `ArrayBuffer`?

Let's try to understand it with an analogy.

Let's suppose we have a set of alphabets - \{A,B,C,D,.....X,Y,Z\}

I could use many combinations of these letters to write greetings in different languages.

- "Hello"
- "Namaste"
- "Salut"
- "Hola"

Even if someone can read the alphabets correctly, if they don't know let's say Hindi, they wouldn't understand the meaning of "Namaste",
They can read it out but it won't make any sense to them.

Worst case it might mean something different in their own language. For example the word "gift" means "poison" in german.

The same thing can be applied to binary data. A binary sequence in itself has no meaning. You can read individual bytes 
but it won't produce the correct output, to get the correct output you need to know what encoding or specification was used to write the binary sequence.

As shown in the table below, the same sequence of bytes when read using different ways results in different numbers.


| Data in binary                   | Representation  | Value               |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| 01011001011001010111001100100001 | Unsigned 8 Bit  | 89 & 101 & 115 & 33 |
| 01011001011001010111001100100001 | Unsigned 16 Bit | 22,885 & 29,473     |
| 01011001011001010111001100100001 | Unsigned 32 Bit | 1,499,820,833       |

Let's take the above example and try to model it using an `ArrayBuffer` and `Typed Arrays`. Suppose we got this data `01011001011001010111001100100001` from a network call.

```javascript
const arrayBuffer = await apiCall();
```

This is how the array buffer looks like. It has 4 bytes of data i.e 32 bits.

import ArrayBuffer from '../../../images/posts/binary-in-javascript-part-1/array-buffer.png';

<img src={ArrayBuffer} alt="ArrayBuffer" />

`Uint8Array` class can read an array buffer as blocks of 8 bits. If we access it using `Uint8Array` as our access layer.
Then `Uint8Array` would view the contents of our `ArrayBuffer` as 4 blocks of data where each block is 1 byte.

```javascript
const arrayBuffer = await apiCall();
arrayBuffer.byteLength; // 4

// 32 bits / 8 bits == 4 blocks

const uint8BitView = new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer);
uint8BitView.length; // 4
```

Each block of data represents a decimal number so we have a total of 4 numbers.

import ArrayBuffer8Bit from '../../../images/posts/binary-in-javascript-part-1/array-buffer-8bit.png';

<img src={ArrayBuffer8Bit} alt="ArrayBuffer" />

---

`Uint16Array` class can read an array buffer as blocks of 16 bits. If we access it using `Uint16Array` as our access layer.
Then `Uint16Array` would view the contents of our `ArrayBuffer` as 2 blocks of data where each block is 2 bytes.

```javascript
const arrayBuffer = await apiCall();
arrayBuffer.byteLength; // 4

// 32 bits / 16 bits == 2 blocks

const uint16BitView = new Uint16Array(arrayBuffer);
uint16BitView.length; // 2
```

Each block of data represents a decimal number so we have a total of 2 numbers.

import ArrayBuffer16Bit from '../../../images/posts/binary-in-javascript-part-1/array-buffer-16bit.png';

<img src={ArrayBuffer16Bit} alt="ArrayBuffer" />

---

`Uint32Array` class can read an array buffer as blocks of 32 bits. If we access it using `Uint32Array` as our access layer.
Then `Uint32Array` would view the contents of our `ArrayBuffer` as 1 block of data where each block is 4 bytes.

```javascript
const arrayBuffer = await apiCall();
arrayBuffer.byteLength; // 4

// 32 bits / 32 bits == 1 block

const uint32BitView = new Uint32Array(arrayBuffer);
uint32BitView.length; // 1
```

Each block of data represents a decimal number so we have only 1 number.

import ArrayBuffer32Bit from '../../../images/posts/binary-in-javascript-part-1/array-buffer-32bit.png';

<img src={ArrayBuffer32Bit} alt="ArrayBuffer" />

But what's the correct value(s)? The answer is it really depends on how the data is meant to be read. For example,
If I wrote a program that saves data in blocks of 16 bits. Then the reader must read the data using `Uint16Array`
to read the correct values.

This is where specification comes in. For example the specification to read png files is [here](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Structure.html)
A specification tells you how you need to interpret the binary data when reading it.

## Example

I am sharing a link to a simple javascript program to write the following json object using a binary specification.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "name": "John",
  "rank": 204209202,
  "hobbies": ["sports", "hiking"]
}
```

Here's another example where the javascrpit program that can read a png file.

## DataView 

Although TypedArrays are sufficient to read binary data but very commonly binary data is written 
in a way that it would take multiple instances of different types of TypedArrays to read it. 

For example if the first 2 bytes in the array buffer represents an unisgned integer, the next 4 bytes represent
a single special character, next 3 bytes represent 3 different ascii character. 

Creating `Uin16Array`, `Uint32Array` and 3 `Uint8Array` classes to correctly view data would be a lot of overhead.
Especially because in a real world the data would be much bigger so you would have to create need a lot more TypedArray classes.

```js
const arrayBuffer = await apiCall();

// creating a view over the underlying `arrayBuffer`
// the view starts from offset `0` in the underlying `arrayBuffer`
// and consist of length 2, where length is measured in number of bytes
const integer = new Uint16Array(arrayBuffer, 0, 2)
integer[0]; // correct value of integer

// the view starts from offset `2` in the underlying `arrayBuffer`, this is
// where the previous view ended
// and it consist of length 4, where length is measured in number of bytes
const specialChar = new Uint32Array(arrayBuffer, 2, 4)
specialChar[0]; // correct value of special character 

const asciiChar1 = new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer, 5, 6)
asciiChar1[0];
const asciiChar2 = new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer, 6, 7)
asciiChar2[0];
```

Nodejs `Buffer` is also a fixed-length sequence of bytes. In fact, After Node v4, The binary data in a Nodejs
`Buffer` is internally stored in a ES6 `ArrayBuffer`. You can access its internal `ArrayBuffer` via the
`.buffer` property.

TODO move this to bottom.

```js
const dataAsBuffer = fs.readFileSync('file');

// When casting the Node.js Buffer to a DataView or TypedArray
// use the `.byteOffset` to refer only to the part of underlying
// ArrayBuffer that contains the memory for `dataAsBuffer`.
// This only happens sometimes when allocating a Buffer smaller than
// Buffer.poolSize, the buffer data does not start from a zero offset
// on the underlying ArrayBuffer. The underlying ArrayBuffer is
// used a shared ArrayBuffer for more than one Buffers
const dataView = new DataView(
  dataAsBuffer.buffer,
  dataAsBuffer.byteOffset,
  dataAsBuffer.byteLength
);
```

TODO move this to bottom.
While `Buffer` provides some methods to work with the binary data stored inside of it, `ArrayBuffer` doesn't have any methods to
read or modify it.
