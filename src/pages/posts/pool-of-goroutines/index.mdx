Being able to send a signaling to a running execution (channel/function/goroutine) is a useful feature.

A recent use case where I used this pattern was, that I had to do some cleanup whenever the docker runtime would signal
my container to stop.

If your program is only running a single goroutine, then you probably don't need this pattern, you could simply add a handler to
the signal and do the cleanup in there.

In our case, the main goroutine would spawn multiple goroutines to split the task.

With this approach, each goroutine, upon exiting, have to do their own cleanup.

Initially I thought, I could add a SIGTERM listerner to each goroutine, but then this thing should be coordinated.

Then I thought, is there a way, where the main goroutine could pass a signal to all the goroutines, wait for all the goroutines to finish
and then do its own cleanup and then exit.

To be honest, reading about this I first found out what context is.
