```typescript
// lib.dom.d.ts
interface Document {
  getElementById(elementId: string): HTMLElement | null;
}

// app.ts
const checkbox = document.getElementById('myCheckbox') as HTMLDivElement;
```

In the code above, `getElementById` function returns an `HTMLElement` which represents an HTML Element,
but if we know the element we are querying is an `HTMLDivElement`, we can downcast the
return type to `HTMLDivElement` using type assertion to access properties specific to a div element.

The following image shows the inheritance chain of an `HTMLDivElement`.

import HTMLElement from '../../../images/posts/typescript-satisfies-operator/html-element.png';

<img src={HTMLElement} alt="Html element" />

Another common use case of the `as` operator is when we want to upcast a type to a broader type.
Like in the example below we are upcasting a `Dog` to an `Animal`.

```typescript
interface Animal {
  canWalk: boolean;
  species: string;
}

interface Dog {
  canWalk: boolean;
  isPet: boolean;
  species: 'dog';
}

function returnADog(): Dog {
  return { canWalk: true, isPet: true, species: 'dog' };
}

// we need to work with a broader type here
// so we are asserting the return type Dog as Animal
const animal = returnADog() as Animal;
```

While it has its use cases, I avoid using it because it can sometimes lead to hidden bugs in your typescript code.

Let's take this perfectly valid Typescript code for instance. We have two files here `types.ts` and `app.ts`.
The `User` interface has two properties.

```typescript
// file: types.ts
export interface User {
  isActive: boolean;
  id: string;
}

export function createUsername(user: User): string | undefined {
  if (user.id) {
    return 'random-username';
  }
  return;
}

// file: app.ts
import { type User, createUsername } from './types.ts';

const user = { isActive: true, id: 'uuid' } as User;
const name = createUsername(user);
```

Let's say there is a new requirement which requires the `User` object to have a
new property called `isVerified` which would be a boolean;

We can update the `User` type by adding a new `isVerified: boolean` property to it and the Typescript compiler
will give us a list of all the places in the codebase where we have to add this new property.

```typescript
// file: types.ts
export interface User {
  isActive: boolean;
  isVerified: boolean; // ++
  id: string;
}
```

Surprisingly Typescript will not throw any compilation error for the code below even though
we can see that the `user` object literal is missing the newly added `isVerified` property.

```typescript
// file: app.ts
import { type User, createUsername } from './types.ts';

const user = { isActive: true, id: '12-34m2ks' } as User;
const name = createUsername(user);
```

The problem with the above code is that the `user` object literal is not a valid `User` but
the Typescript compiler assumes it is because of our assertion.
The TypeScript compiler would then also assume that it has all the properties of a `User` when it clearly
is missing the `isVerified` property.

Subtle bugs like these get even harder to spot in larger codebases where variable declarations are
far from where they are used.

This error-prone behaviour of Typescript is because of how the `as` keyword works.

> When you use the **as** keyword, it implies that you are responsible for the type safety of that line of code; not the TypeScript compiler.

## The Assertion Operator \`as\`

TypeScript allows type assertions that convert to a more specific or less specific version of a type.

A **less specific type** is a type that has some properties of another type but not all.

A **more specific type** is a type that has all the properties of another type and some more.

```typescript
true as false; // ‚úÖ since both are boolean
1 as 3; // ‚úÖ since both are numbers
// ‚ùå since there is no overlap between { hello: "world" } and String{} type
{ hello: "world" } as string;
// ‚úÖ since { indexOf: (term: string) => { return number; } } is a less specific type of String{} type
// Remember String.indexOf ?
{ indexOf: (term: string) => { return 2; } } as string;
```

Only ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù coercions like the followings are not allowed.

```typescript
3 as '2'; // no overlap between the number 3 and string '2'
'hello' as Symbol; // no overlap
3 as undefined; // no overlap
```

In our case, `{ isActive: true, id: "user" } as User` is allowed because it is a less specific type
of `User`. It has one less property than a `User`. This can lead to many hidden errors.

```typescript
interface User {
  isActive: boolean;
  isVerified: boolean;
  id: string;
}

{ isActive: true, id: "uuid" } as User; // ‚úÖ less specific type assertion
```

## Type Validation

With the new `satisfies` operator, you can use type assertion and still let Typescript validate the type of the value that you are asserting.

~~When you use the `as` keyword, it implies that you are responsible for the type safety of that line of code; not the TypeScript compiler.~~ -
_**No longer valid if you use it with the `satisfies` operator**._

If we go back to our example, this is how we'd use it.

```typescript
// file: app.ts
import { type User, createUsername } from './types.ts';

const user = { isActive: true, id: 'uuid' } satisfies User as User;
const name = createUsername(user);
```

Now, the Typescript compiler will fully validate the type of our `user` object literal with `User` type.

import Error from '../../../images/posts/typescript-satisfies-operator/satisfies-error.png';

<img src={Error} alt="Satisfies Error Typescript" />

As a general practice, every time you use the `as` operator, you should use the `satisfies` operator
to let the type safety be handled by Typescript instead of you.

## Preserving Original Type

The `satisfies` operator is only used to validate the structure. It does not affect the type of the variable.

```typescript
// type of a is still 1 which satisfies the type number
const a = 1 satisfies number;

interface BinaryFile {
  name: string;
}

interface TextFile {
  name: string;
}

const bfile: TextFile = { name: 'x.b' } satisfies BinaryFile;
```

In the above example, even though the object literal `{ name: 'x.b' }` satisfies to be a `BinaryFile`,
the expression `satisfies BinaryFile` has no impact on the type of the variable `bfile`. It is still a `TextFile`.

This feature comes in handy when you have an object with no explicit type and you want to preserve its inferred type.
For example, the config object below has no explicit type assigned to it. In this scenario, Typescript
will infer its type based on its structure.

```typescript
const config = {
  name: 'app-1',
  version: '2.0',
  service: 'users',
};
```

The inferred type would be.

```typescript
const config: {
  name: string;
  version: string;
  service: string;
};
```

import InferredType from '../../../images/posts/typescript-satisfies-operator/inferred-type.png';

<img src={InferredType} alt="Inferred type" />

Let's say we do want to add some type of validation to the config object. One way to do this is
to assign it to an explicit type as shown below:

```typescript
const config: Record<string, string> = {
  name: 'app-1',
  version: '2.0',
  service: 'users',
};
```

The problem with this approach is that now you lose the inferred type with explicit keys. As a result,
you no longer get IntelliSense for its keys.

import ExplicitType from '../../../images/posts/typescript-satisfies-operator/explicit-type.png';

<img src={ExplicitType} alt="Explicit type" />

Another approach is to keep using the inferred type of the object but validate it with the `satisfies` keyword.

```typescript
const config = {
  name: 'app-1',
  version: '2.0',
  service: 'users',
} satisfies Record<string, string>;
```

This way you get the type validation on the object and you also get to preserve the inferred type of the object.

import SatisfiesPreserveType from '../../../images/posts/typescript-satisfies-operator/satisfied-preserve-type.png';

<img src={SatisfiesPreserveType} alt="Satisfies preserve type" />

Once again, this is only possible because using the `satisfies` operator does not affect the `type` of the value.

The `satisfies` operator is yet another Typescript feature that helps in improving the type safety of a codebase
and preventing human errors. But like every other typescript feature, you have to first use it correctly to leverage its benefits.
