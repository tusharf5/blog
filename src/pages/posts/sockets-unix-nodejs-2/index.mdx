talk about fd being a controlled reference to a resource given by kernel. like ok you want to interact with a socket.
here is a unique fd.

kernel maintains a list of all open fds and each has its own metadata like what processs can access it with what perms.

The process uses the FD as a handle to interact with a specific resource. It provides operations like read, write, close, and others based on the resource type.

use this blog as a reference - https://dev.to/ocodista/inside-nodejs-exploring-asynchronous-io-4bg1

talk about recv recvfrom.

talk about how data gets send from NIC to the process.

talk about epoll, epollwait, etc.

## From The Eyes Of Nodejs

In Node.js, which is primarily single-threaded, a listening socket is automatically created when a new HTTP server is created, and new `Accept`ed connections are automatically added to the event loop's poll phase queue as callbacks i.e we don't have to directly make system calls to retreive new connections.

Each connection object, represented by an instance of the Node.js socket class, can listen for the data event to receive data from its client side. And each data event callback is also added to the poll phase queue.

net.createServer creates a socket, binds it to an IP/port, and sets it to listening mode, while net.createConnection creates an active socket behind the scenes and initiates a connection based on the configuration options.

Here's an example of how to create a server and handle incoming connections:

```js
const net = require("node:net");

const server = net.createServer((c) => {
  // c is an instance of net.Socket which is
  // is a nodejs abstracrtion around sockets
  console.log("client connected");
  c.on("end", () => {
    console.log("client disconnected");
  });

  c.on("data", (data) => {
    // incoming data from the client socket
  });

  c.write("hello\r\n");

  c.close();
});

//
server.listen(8124, () => {
  console.log("server bound");
});
```

And here's an example of how to create a client connection:

```js
const net = require("node:net");

const socket = net.createConnection(port, host);
console.log("Socket created.");

socket.on("data", function (data) {
  // Log the response from the HTTP server.
  console.log("RESPONSE: " + data);
});

socket.on("connect", function () {
  // Manually write an HTTP request.
  socket.write("GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n");
});

socket.on("end", function () {
  console.log("DONE");
});
```

The socket, in its essence, represents the fundamental building block of communication in the digital realm. It symbolizes the connection between two endpoints, bridging the gap between the physical and virtual worlds.

In conclusion, the understanding of sockets is a critical aspect of networking. Sockets serve as the fundamental building blocks of network communication, allowing two or more computers to exchange data, bridging the gap between the physical and virtual worlds.
